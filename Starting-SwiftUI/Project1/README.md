## WeSplit
* This project is a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave. The project in itself isn’t complicated, but we’ll be taking it slow so you can see exactly how these fundamentals fit together.

* In some respects going back to the basics like this will feel odd – you’ve learned about closures, optionals, and throwing functions, and now there’s a bit of a reset as we look at the basics of SwiftUI. But take hope: there’s a lot of value in being able to approach new topics with a fresh mind. As Meister Eckhart said, “be willing to be a beginner every single morning” – do that, and you’ll learn much faster.
